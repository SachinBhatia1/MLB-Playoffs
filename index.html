            <h2>All Eyes on Shohei Ohtani</h2>

        <p>- - Los Angeles CA. 
            <p>Shohei Ohtani has had a historic season. He became the first player in MLB history to join the 50 HR and 50 SB in a season club, hitting 54 home runs and swiping 59 bags. After a dismal 6-5 loss last night to the San Diego Padres, the best team in the MLB this season faces elimination tonight in game 4 of the NLDS. All eyes are on Shohei Ohtani tonight as Dodger fans are hoping for the Dodgers to even up the series tonight and force a decisive game 5 back in Los Angeles Friday night. For many fans, the Dodgers were an easy lock for a NLCS trip, if not the World Series. A big part of the Padres success was the bat of Fernando Tatis Jr. Tatis Jr through 5 2024 playoff games has a .556 batting average with 10 hits, including 4 RBIs. He had a monster 2-run home run last night to push the Padres lead in the 4th inning to 6-1. For many fans, all eyes are on Shohei Ohtani. After a huge signing of 700 million dollars, the Dodgers are hoping to make the most of Ohtani's historic season. We will see if the Dodgers have enough tonight to force a decisive game 5 back in Los Anglees on Friday night.  First pitch tonight is 9:08PM ET. The Padres have Dylan Cease on the hill tonight, while the Dodgers still have yet to decide thier starter. You can catch the game on   <a href="https://www.mlb.tv">MLB TV</a></li> <nav>
